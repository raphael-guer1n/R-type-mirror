# R-Type: A Game Engine that Roars!

This is our implementation of the **R-Type multiplayer game** for the B-CPP-500 project at **Epitech**.

The goal is twofold:
1. Implement a **network multiplayer version** of the legendary 90's Shoot'em Up, R-Type.
2. Build a **custom game engine** that demonstrates real-world architecture patterns, separation of concerns, and networking.

## Build and Run

### Requirements
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC on Windows)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (>= 3.18 recommended)
- Package manager: Conan, Vcpkg, or CMake-CPM

### Build instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/r-type.git

```

Binaries:
- `r-type_server`
- `r-type_client`
