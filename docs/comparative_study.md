## 6. Conclusion

For a real-time multiplayer game like **R-Type**, low latency and efficient bandwidth usage are non-negotiable.  
After evaluating the alternatives, we adopt a stack that balances **speed**, **robustness**, and **implementation complexity**:

- **Transport:** Raw TCP is too slow for action gameplay, and ‚Äúpure‚Äù UDP is too unreliable. **UDP with Quake-style reliability (sequence/ack numbers)** provides the right middle ground: fast delivery with enough signal to detect loss and recover gracefully.
- **Game Data:** Re-sending the whole world each tick (full snapshots) would quickly saturate the network. **Delta Snapshots** only transmit changes since the last acknowledged state, drastically reducing bandwidth. Pairing this with **UserCmd batching** on the client side improves lag tolerance and enables client-side prediction and reconciliation.
- **Networking Library:** **Asio Standalone** offers a clean, header-only, asynchronous API that compiles fast and works on all platforms without pulling the entire Boost ecosystem‚Äîideal for both coursework and production-like prototypes.
- **Package Manager:** We choose **vcpkg** to ensure consistent cross-platform builds via the CMake toolchain file and triplets. This simplifies teammate onboarding and CI, while keeping dependencies (like Asio) reproducible across macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Framework:** We choose **SDL2** as our multimedia layer.  
  It is portable across Windows, Linux, and macOS, integrates well with OpenGL,  
  and provides reliable input, audio, and rendering. Compared to SFML, SDL2 is  
  lower-level but more flexible and widely adopted in both academia and industry.  
  This makes it the most appropriate choice for our R-Type project.

**Bottom line:**  
**UDP (Quake-style) + Delta Snapshots + UserCmd batching + Asio Standalone, managed with vcpkg** gives us the **best balance** of performance, reliability, portability, and learning value for the R-Type project.
